<!-- 				<h2>FMX Studio</h2>
				<p>
					FMX was founded by a couple of 3D film makers and VR professional who have a combined 15 years of immersive project production experience. They believed 360 degree video is not VR and share a goal to bring an immersive VR experience to the market through an interactive magical dream world. The production house is structured with the newest international 3D  technology products. We have staff that includes an Awarded filmmaker, Computer Engineer, Programmer, 2D/3D animation designer, and surround sound engineer. Along with this we have a strong relationship with well-known Hollywood 3D filmmakers and production teams. FMX has established VR / AR lab with Dell, CICC and Advanced Imagine Society at CCTV in Beijing China.
